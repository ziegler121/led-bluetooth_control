# Arduino Uno Smart Home Lighting Simulation Project

This mini project is a very structurally simple home lighting simulation project using the Arduino microcontroller but its functionality can be extended to much more structurally complex systems.

In this project:
- An LED (lighting system used) was controlled by the **HC-05 Bluetooth module** and a simple mobile app
- This very simple Bluetooth app for the sole purpose of this project was developed using the MIT App Inventor website
- The app has a very simple interface:
    + A ListPicker for selecting the address of the Bluetooth module in order to pair with it
    + Two buttons named 'S)' and 'DUM'. 'S)' is the Ghanaian Language for 'TURN ON' while 'DUM' is for 'TURN OFF'

This whole interface works in tandem in order to make it possible for switching an LEDS or several LEDs ON or OFF using the Bluetooth module and mobile phone
